# ESP32 Joystick Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to interface a joystick with an ESP32 microcontroller to capture analog input values from both the X and Y axes. Joysticks are commonly used in gaming consoles and robotics for precise control over movements and actions.

## Components Needed
- ESP32 Microcontroller
- Joystick Module
- Jumper Wires
- Breadboard

## Circuit Setup
1. **Connecting the Joystick to ESP32:**
   - Connect the X axis pin of the joystick module to analog pin A0 on the ESP32.
   - Connect the Y axis pin of the joystick module to analog pin A1 on the ESP32.
   - Ensure the power (VCC) and ground (GND) connections are properly established between the joystick module and ESP32.

## Instructions
1. **Setup:**
   - Initialize serial communication at a baud rate of 115200 in the `setup()` function to monitor joystick readings.
   
2. **Operation:**
   - In the `loop()` function:
     - Read analog values from both the X and Y axes using `analogRead()`.
     - Store these values in variables (`xValue` and `yValue`).
     - Print the analog values to the Serial Monitor to visualize joystick position.

3. **Considerations:**
   - **Joystick Calibration:** Adjust the joystick module for optimal sensitivity and center position.
   - **Analog Input Range:** Capture full analog range values (typically 0-1023) for accurate joystick positioning.
   - **Application-Specific Usage:** Customize control logic based on joystick readings for specific project requirements.

## Applications
- **Robotics:** Control movement of robot arms or vehicles.
- **Gaming:** Interface with games or simulations requiring analog joystick input.
- **Remote Control:** Implement in remote control systems for smooth and precise operation.

## Notes
- **Serial Output:** Monitor real-time joystick position and adjust code or mechanics as needed for optimal performance.
- **Analog Input Handling:** Use `analogRead()` to capture continuous analog values from the joystick axes.
- **Debugging:** Use the Serial Monitor to troubleshoot and fine-tune joystick response and sensitivity.
